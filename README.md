# SearchEngine
A pseudo search engine with fake articles. No, this can't display your website. Sorry, SEO specialists!

To download the code, simply download as a ZIP file or use GitHub desktop. Run the file using Python and peruse it via your code editor or even on GitHub.

I made this as a side project for when I'm bored. Spoiler alert: I'm bored a lot.

This is purely for educational purposes. Please don't use it in your own search engine. The code is not perfect, nowhere near it. Username-password combinations are stored in JSON files, which is NOT recommended.
